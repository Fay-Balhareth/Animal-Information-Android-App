# Animal-Information-Android-App

The app's lifecycle begins with the Main Activity, where users interact with the interface and initiate searches for animal information. Upon launching the app, the Main Activity initializes, followed by the onStart() method, where the app prepares to become visible to the user. As users navigate through the app, they trigger various lifecycle callbacks such as onResume(), onPause(), and onStop(), depending on their interactions. Finally, when the user exits the app, the onStop() and onDestroy() methods are invoked, marking the end of the app's lifecycle until the next launch.
